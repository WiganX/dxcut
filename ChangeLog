* Hello GitHub!
*   This is the initial commit of dxcut to github (moving from sourceforge).
*   For anyone who may actually be familiar with the project from sourceforge
*   this repository omits anything not directly related to the dxcut library
*   (no tools).  Any tools that will continue to be maintained will have their
*   own repository.
